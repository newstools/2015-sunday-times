The admission follows CSA officials' denials of interference in selection for the match, first reported by Times Media.A statement said a review panel comprising three of CSA's own independent directors had investigated claims that the board or sports minister Fikile Mbalula had insisted that the team include a fourth player of colour."The convenor (of selectors, Andrew Hudson) and coach (Russell Domingo) had consulted Lorgat who had impressed upon them the need to properly consider the best XI bearing in mind the transformation guidelines," a CSA statement said.According to multiple sources, SA were forced to change the side they wanted - the same team who had thrashed Sri Lanka in the quarterfinal. They opted to include Vernon Philander, who was coming back from injury and short of match practice, at the expense of Kyle Abbott, their best bowler in the tournament in terms of average, economy rate and strike rate.The match in Auckland on March 24 was decided with the penultimate delivery, which New Zealand's Grant Elliott smashed for six to stop SA from reaching the World Cup final for the first time.But, not for the first time, CSA disputed much of that sequence of events."Having successfully undergone a fitness test Philander was declared fit and available for selection by the medical team," the statement said. "Direct inquiry with him by the coach confirmed his readiness to play."Hudson, Domingo and Lorgat confirmed they had received, individually or collectively, no instructions or no interference from anyone, specifically not from the minister of sport or from members of the CSA board."Domingo confirmed he never received an SMS from Lorgat as alleged (in media reports) and Lorgat in turn confirmed that he had never sent an SMS to Domingo."The statement said "Hudson and Domingo confirmed, on behalf of the selection panel" their awareness of "transformation guidelines which require the panel to consider, on merit, the selection of at least four players of colour in the starting XI".CSA president Chris Nenzani called the reports of interference "unfounded and mischievous", and the statement said the board would not comment further on the issue.Earlier yesterday, CSA tried to quell the fire started by team consultant Mike Horn, who told reporters in Shanghai this week, "What actually happened was the team (originally selected for the semifinal) was the team that played against Sri Lanka (in the quarterfinal)."In a letter that CSA said yesterday Horn had written to them, the explorer contradicted himself.
