"Garam masala can be made using as few as five or as many as 15 different spices; but never without dhania (coriander seeds," says Asha. "Roasting or heating the seeds in a dry pan heightens the flavour and makes them crisp enough to grind to a powder. Garam masala should be used sparingly; sprinkle a little into the pot when your curry is almost cooked."Asha's Spice Box: A glossary of exotic Indian ingredientsIngredients:100g whole coriander seeds50g whole cumin seeds50g whole fennel seeds50g cinnamon sticks25g black peppercorns50g black cardamom pods20g bay leaves50g green cardamom pods50g star anise25g cloves3 whole nutmegMethod:1) Toast all the ingredients, except the cloves and nutmeg, in a dry pan till fragrant.2) Allow to cool and grind everything together, including cloves and nutmeg.
