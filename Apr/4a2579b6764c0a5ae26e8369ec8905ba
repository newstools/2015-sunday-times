On March 3 2009, Pakistani cricket suffered a cruel blow when the bus carrying the Sri Lankan test team was attacked by militants near Lahore's Gaddafi Stadium, leaving eight people dead and seven visiting players wounded.That tragic incident forced the suspension of all international cricket in Pakistan.No team was willing to risk their safety to visit Pakistan, beginning an unwanted odyssey for the 1992 world champions, who have played most of their "home" matches since 2009 in the United Arab Emirates.Zimbabwe's trip is likely to be confined to Lahore and last only a week, but the sight of a test-status team in Pakistan will send an important message.Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Shaharyar Khan was upbeat as his efforts behind the scenes look to be bearing fruit.As well as Zimbabwe, an Australian army team is due in Pakistan next week to play their local counterparts, and Khan hailed the developments as "opening another door" towards full rehabilitation. I have no regrets, says Hudson"We believe that shortly Pakistan would be hosting age-group teams, 'A' teams and women's teams, and in due course, once confidence in our security arrangements improves, senior teams as well," he told AFP.Khan, in his second tenure as PCB chief, drew on his experience as a former foreign secretary and built slowly."The idea was to go for what was doable," he said.But Zimbabwe have not arrived yet - their security team is due to visit soon to assess the situation - and even small steps to revive home matches have been stymied at the last minute in recent years.In 2012, Bangladesh twice backed out after agreeing to tour, on both occasions their government declaring that Pakistan was unsafe.A new generation of players, including new one-day skipper Azhar Ali and left-arm seamers Junaid Khan and Rahat Ali, has grown up not playing international cricket at home.Head coach Waqar Younis recently told AFP he feared for the future of Pakistani cricket if the exile carried on."No international cricket [at home] has hit Pakistan badly," he said. "If it is not revived in the next couple of years, I fear the game will die down."
