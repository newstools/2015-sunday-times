Serves: 4Ingredients:800g whole sweet potatoes2 large eggsSalt and pepper, to tasteAbout 60ml (1/4 cup) olive oilToppings, of your choice (smoked salmon, cream cheese, capers and microgreens work well for breakfast)Tonight's supper: Low-carb chorizo & cabbage pieMethod:1) Peel the sweet potatoes and immerse in cold water until ready to use - this prevents oxidisation.2) Finely grate the sweet potatoes into a colander and squeeze out as much juice as you can. Place in a large bowl, add the eggs, season with salt and pepper and mix well.3) Preheat a 20cm stainless-steel non-stick Le Creuset pan on the stove on medium heat. Pour about 30ml (2 tbsp) olive oil into the pan. Place a quarter of the sweet-potato batter into the pan and spread evenly with the back of a spoon. Fry until the bottom is light brown, then flip over like a pancake and cook the other side until light brown.4) Remove the rosti, add oil to the pan if needed and repeat 3 times for the remaining batter.5) Slide the r sti onto an oven tray and bake in a preheated oven at 180 for about 15 minutes. Serve with toppings of your choice.For a robust family breakfast (or lunch, or supper) serve the rosti topped with Franck's special ratatouille and/or his fricassee of celeriac and chorizo - find these recipes at www.lecreuset.co.za.
