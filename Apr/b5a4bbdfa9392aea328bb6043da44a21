As a buyer, Nicola Stevenson travels the world thinking about what we ll be wearing next season, and the next. She admits, however, that she s built her own wardrobe around classics, which make the perfect base for some of the trends she s championing this winter.While looking undeniably feminine, Nicola is liberally borrowing from the boys. The dungarees have a boy sort of feel to them, she says. Even the bag is quite briefcasey. And she calls her Bottega Veneta shoes little tuxedos .Flirting with menswear is a cornerstone of Nicola s personal style, but it also happens to be a great way to smarten up the comfy, easy-to-wear, versatile items that are going to be huge for the season ahead. Because, let s face it, winter is about dressing for comfort. That oversized poncho is perfect for the job; it adds interest, and it can go from breakfast to a meeting to lunch, and look great all the way.It's sexy, it's '70s, and it's back in fashion As soon as you put on a menswear-inspired tailored piece, it looks sharp and put-together, says Nicola. Men s stuff gives you that edge. The bold combination of black and white has been underpinning fashion for a while, but it s got legs, and Nicola sees the trend lasting at least until winter 2016. It complements the menswear theme beautifully, while also being incredibly versatile. It s striking and really easy, she adds.For Nicola, it s all held together by another trend that s peeping through this season: a contemporary reinvention of the 70s. It s not literal, as it has been in the past, with that boho vibe, she says. It s modernised, and I think everything talks to that.
