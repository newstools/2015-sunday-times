Rub in the butter with your fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs.3) In a separate bowl, mix the buttermilk and egg then add to the dry ingredients. Use a knife to incorporate until you have a soft dough. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic. Roll dough out into a rectangle about 20cm wide on a lightly floured surface. 4) For the filling, spread caramel over the dough, then sprinkle with almonds, peel, raisins and spices (above). Carefully roll dough up to form a long sausage and pinch the edges to seal. Using a sharp serrated knife, cut rounds about 4cm thick and pack snugly into the prepared cake pan. Bake for 15-20 minutes or until risen and golden.5) For the topping, brush buns with warm honey while still warm. Mix the icing sugar and buttermilk, place in a bag and pipe crosses over the tops of the buns.Cook's tip:You can substitute the caramel with chocolate hazelnut spread if you prefer.Visit Katelyn's blog The Kate Tin.
