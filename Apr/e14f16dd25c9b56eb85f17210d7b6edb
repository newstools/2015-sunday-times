10 HERBS FOR YOUR TEA GARDENWHERE TO PLANT TEA HERBSMost tea herbs can be grown in containers and some even on windowsills. In winter it s great to have herbs indoors to snip without running out into the freezing night to pick them, but they do grow best in large pots or out in the garden, if you have one. Pick a bunch daily to have at hand in the kitchen, for early morning tea and cooking of an evening.HOW TO BREW YOUR OWN CUSTOM CUPPAIf you re a dedicated sipper of Ceylon, rooibos, green or China tea, you can still add a fresh leaf or two to give your cup an added lift and it s fun to experiment with different combinations. Sweeten with honey if you like.Flavour depends on the quantity of leaves you use for your infusion and how long you allow it to steep or brew at least five minutes, but not more than 15, is a basic guide.Note: Always consult your doctor before trying herbal remedies.
