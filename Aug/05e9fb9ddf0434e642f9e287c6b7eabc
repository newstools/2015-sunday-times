1. NANDI MNGOMA: @NANDIMNGOMAWe are in love with musician Nandi and especially her hair. She rocks a fade better than any man (yes, we're talking to you, Big Sean) and she even rocked a box cut better than Jazzy Jeff. Even though she occasionally rocks box braids, we prefer Nandi with her short do.A photo posted by nandi mngoma (@nandimngoma) on Aug 9, 2015 at 8:14am PDT A photo posted by nandi mngoma (@nandimngoma) on Aug 4, 2015 at 3:32am PDT A photo posted by nandi mngoma (@nandimngoma) on Aug 9, 2015 at 8:14am PDT A photo posted by nandi mngoma (@nandimngoma) on Aug 4, 2015 at 3:32am PDT 2. SOLANGE: @SAINTRECORDSSolo, as the singer and record company owner's fans affectionately call her, changes her hair quite often. Not all of it is natural, but we have two Solo looks we will forever love: her super long box braids and her dope afro. We'll also never forget her s-curl days.

TK WONDER &amp; CIPRIANA QUANN: @TK_WONDER &amp; @CIPRIANAQUANNYou can't miss all that hair. It's incredible. We thought it was fake hair that's supposed to look natural, but the sisters (one is a musician and the other a blogger) told Marie Claire US that it's all theirs. What? How? We don't know, but we do know that it looks absolutely amazing.A photo posted by Tk Wonder (@tk_wonder) on Jul 27, 2015 at 3:38pm PDTA photo posted by Tk Wonder (@tk_wonder) on Jul 27, 2015 at 3:38pm PDT A photo posted by Cipriana Quann (@ciprianaquann) on Aug 4, 2015 at 6:28pm PDT 5. PEARL THUSI: @PEARLTHUSIOkay, so the actress and presenter straightened it for the cover of ELLE magazine, but Pearl's hair embodies #HairGoals to the max. It has volume, it's beautiful and you can play around with it so much. It's Diana Ross hair on steroids.8 of the chicest fashionistas to follow on InstagramA photo posted by Pearl Thusi- Real Black Pearl (@pearlthusi) on Aug 8, 2015 at 7:59am PDTA photo posted by Pearl Thusi- Real Black Pearl (@pearlthusi) on Aug 8, 2015 at 7:59am PDT A photo posted by Pearl Thusi- Real Black Pearl (@pearlthusi) on Jul 10, 2015 at 5:41am PDT 6. LUPITA NYONG'O: @LUPITANYONGOShe rocks a brush cut better than most people, but sometimes the Oscar-winning actress will play around with a cute afro on the red carpet. Even when she gets a little help in the length department (like she did at Cannes), it still has a natural look and texture.

AVA DUVERNAY: @DIRECTHERThe Selma director has the most gorgeous locks around. They're long and shiny, although we imagine they must be high maintenance. We love it when she wears them down and she makes them so chic when she rocks an up do on the red carpet.

BONNIE MBULI: @OFFICIALBONBIZZLEBonnie rocked a shaven head back in the 90s when almost everyone else on TV had box braids or relaxed hair. Nowadays the Afternoon Express presenter looks amazing with a fade, and we especially love the Nelson Mandela-style line she sported on the cover of True Love.A photo posted by Bonnie Mbuli (@officialbonbizzle) on Jul 7, 2015 at 1:00pm PDTA photo posted by Bonnie Mbuli (@officialbonbizzle) on Jul 7, 2015 at 1:00pm PDT A photo posted by Bonnie Mbuli (@officialbonbizzle) on Jul 21, 2015 at 1:14pm PDT 9. YAGAZIE EMEZI: @YAGAZIEEMEZIThat hair is killer! Not to take away from the YouTuber's all-round coolness, but her hair should have its own fan club because it's the hair dreams are made of. Whether she wears it up or down, it's always worth drooling over.Score! 20 bargain beauty buys under R200A photo posted by Yagazie Emezi (@yagazieemezi) on Jun 18, 2015 at 2:55pm PDTA photo posted by Yagazie Emezi (@yagazieemezi) on Jun 18, 2015 at 2:55pm PDT A photo posted by Yagazie Emezi (@yagazieemezi) on Jul 21, 2015 at 2:46pm PDT 10. FKA TWIGS: @FKATWIGSMusician Twigs has lovely, curly locks that she wears in a whole lot of different ways. We love it when her hair is plaited, although our favourite twigs look is when she rocked beaded braids. Let's not forget her trademark gelled-up baby hair...A photo posted by FKA twigs (@fkatwigs) on Sep 13, 2014 at 4:01am PDTA photo posted by FKA twigs (@fkatwigs) on Sep 13, 2014 at 4:01am PDT A photo posted by FKA twigs (@fkatwigs) on Oct 20, 2014 at 8:13am PDT 11. LIRA: @MISS_LIRALira ditched 999 Records and her R&amp;B-style sound a decade ago, she also ditched the braids and went 100% natural. The singer reminds us how gorgeous and chic a mini-fro is.

TRACEE ELLIS ROSS: @TRACEEELLISROSSHer mom is Diana Ross, one of our ultimate hair icons. Luckily for the Black-ish actress, she inherited that super gorgeous mane, and we especially love it when she wears it loose and mid-length, like she did on the cover of Essence magazine a few months back.A photo posted by Tracee Ellis Ross (@traceeellisross) on Aug 17, 2015 at 12:00pm PDTA photo posted by Tracee Ellis Ross (@traceeellisross) on Aug 17, 2015 at 12:00pm PDT A photo posted by Tracee Ellis Ross (@traceeellisross) on Jun 30, 2015 at 1:26pm PDT
