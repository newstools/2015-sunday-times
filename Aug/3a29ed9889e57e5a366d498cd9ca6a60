If Nottinghamshire can produce a seaming, English wicket then we know this Australian team is flaky. In this match their batsmen at three, four, five and six contributed 46 runs in eight innings. That is remarkable and tells a big story.As soon as England are on a pitch with life for swing and seam bowling touching a 130km/h, then they are a match for any other team.If James Anderson is out of the game, then put even more juice in the pitch. No disrespect to whoever plays, but they will not be as good as Anderson. Cyclone rains on Proteas paradeThis was a clinical England side that hammered the Aussies in Birmingham within three days.This series has been remarkable. We simply do not know which team will turn up on Thursday. Will it be England from Cardiff and Birmingham or England from Lord's?It is clear the short break between tests did England a service. It took them away from each other, freshened up minds and allowed players to think about their individual games and positions. They were able to reconnect with what went right at Cardiff and forget what went wrong at Lord's. This week was a fresh start.This is a young England team and they are revved up by playing at grounds like Edgbaston. Young players love the singing, the fancy dress and the Barmy Army. Perhaps the hush of Lord's was too much for them; maybe too formal.There are great signs. Stuart Broad is leading the attack with the ball and Moeen Ali at No8 must be a real nightmare for the Aussies.Also, fast bowler Steven Finn looks stronger in his approach to the crease.England will go 2-1 up but Australia only need to draw the series to retain the Ashes. So England have to go for it this coming week. Give Australia nothing. - The Daily Telegraph, London
