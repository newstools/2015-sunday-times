1. CLEAN UPBegin removing winter debris and unwanted groundcover from your flowerbeds. If you haven t yet pruned your trees, do so now before the tree begins to open its buds.2. CUT AND FEEDPrepare your lawn for spring by giving it a good cut, raking and spiking and cover with organic lawn dressing. Use a combination of compost and fertilisers to feed your plants. 3. GROWIf you are looking to plant seeds for seedlings or veggies, you can do so in a greenhouse or protected area with some plastic to cover; this will give you a head-start for spring.4. FIXWarmer weather means the plants will start needing more water. Have a run-through of the irrigation system to find broken pipes, broken or blocked sprays, faulty valves and, of course, plants blocking sprays (as plants get taller, spray stands must be lengthened and spray heads adjusted).5. PEST CONTROLThe new growth should not be showing yet, so now is a good time to look for and eradicate garden pests.
