The left-hander, who turns 38 in October, will end his 15-year international cricket career after the second test against India being played at the PSara Oval in Colombo.Statistics may not always tell the whole story, but in his case they illuminate a glorious career marked with a prolific hunger for runs and the ability to dominate rival attacks.His 12350 runs from 133 tests with 38 centuries put him in fifth place in the all-time run-getters' list and head and shoulders above those still playing.Sangakkara, the finest left-hander yet in terms of runs and centuries, also boasts the highest average of 57.71 among the 10 most prolific test batsmen yet. He has compiled 200-plus scores 11 times - 10 double centuries and a triple hundred - leaving him just one short of Australian legend Don Bradman's record of 12.Sri Lankan fans will hope Sangakkara signs off in style, just as he did when he bowed out of Twenty20 internationals last year by smashing an unbeaten 52 to steer Sri Lanka past India in the World Twenty20 final in Dhaka.Then, having decided to retire from one-day cricket after the World Cup this year, Sangakkara became the first batsman to hit four consecutive centuries in the showpiece event where Sri Lanka made the quarterfinals.Sangakkara also wanted to quit tests after the World Cup, but accepted a request from selectors to stay on and agreed to play two tests each against Pakistan and India.Asked about his plans after retirement, Sangakkara hinted at playing a few more years of non-international cricket, such as turning out for English county Surrey or taking part in Twenty20 leagues."I'll be playing a couple of more years of cricket and then find a real job," he said."It's great nowadays that even after you say goodbye to international cricket, you can still play some cricket."A recent poll by Cricinfo had a staggering 48% of respondents vote for Sangakkara as Sri Lanka's greatest cricketer, 15% more than all-time wicket-taking record holder Muttiah Muralitharan, who was billed as the obvious choice.
