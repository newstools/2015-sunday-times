BANTING BROCCOLI FRITTERS 1) In a food processor combine 8 florets of fresh broccoli (or cauliflower, or 2-3 courgettes, chopped); 2 spring onions, chopped; 1 clove of garlic, chopped; 1 small red pepper, chopped; a small handful of fresh parsley; and 30ml (2 tbsp) pumpkin seeds. Process till you have a breadcrumb-like mixture.2) Add 45ml (3 tbsp) grated parmesan cheese, 1 extra-large egg, 45ml (3 tbsp) tapioca flour and 2.5ml ( tsp) baking powder and process again.3) Preheat a non-stick pan with 30ml (2 tbsp) coconut oil and drop tablespoons of the mixture into the hot oil, flattening slightly. Cook for 3 minutes per side, carefully turning each patty. Continue frying, adding coconut oil if needed.4) Serve warm, topped with cheese, ham or both; or serve cold, topped with a blob of cream cheese, a slice of smoked salmon or smoked mackerel, a grinding of black pepper and a wedge of lemon. Makes 8-12. 3. SPEEDY CHOCOLATE COCONUT CLUSTERS 1) Break 300g dark chocolate (70%) in a heat-proof glass bowl and place over another bowl of hot water, ensuring the base of the bowl is not touching the water. Stir until completely melted.2) Stir in 3 cups (750ml) toasted coconut flakes and a handful of lightly toasted chopped blanched almonds.3) Line a baking tray with greaseproof paper or a Teflon mat. Using a tablespoon drop spoonfuls onto the paper/mat and allow to set in a cool place - but not the fridge as the chocolate will lose its shine. Sprinkle the top of each cluster lightly with coarse salt (pink Himalayan is very pretty), taking care not to make it too salty. Makes about 24.
