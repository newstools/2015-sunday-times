Clarke was speaking after England won the fourth test at Trent Bridge by an innings and 78 runs to regain the Ashes."I want to play the last test at The Oval and give it one more crack. The time is right," the 34-year-old said."You never want to walk away. My performances over the past 12 months have not been acceptable to me."Test cricket is about the Ashes. We tried our best, I certainly tried my best, but we got outplayed."England ripped out the last three Australia wickets for 12 runs yesterday. Ben Stokes had Mitchell Starc caught by Ian Bell at second slip for nought and Mark Wood bowled Josh Hazlewood for a duck.Wood produced another ferocious full-pitched delivery to shatter Nathan Lyon's stumps and complete the rout, sparking wild celebrations on the pitch and all around the ground."It's unbelievable. I couldn't be happier," England captain Alastair Cook said.England lost the last Ashes series in Australia in 2013-14 5-0 and the touring side had been strong favourites to retain it."For what we've been through over the past 18 months, to play like we did has been fantastic," Cook said."I'm so proud of this young team and the way they've taken this opportunity."Clarke has played 114 tests and scored over 8000 runs, including 28 centuries."I certainly don't want to jump ship and leave the boys now," he said. "I pride myself on leading from the front so (my form has) been disappointing."One-day cricket is about the World Cup, test cricket is about the Ashes. We got outplayed, we got beaten. It's time for the next generation of players, the next captain, to have his opportunity to try to build the team again and get them ready for the next Ashes series." Clarke revealed that he made the decision on Friday evening."I felt my performances weren't as good as I wanted them to be," he said.
