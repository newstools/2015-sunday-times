Having recovered from a hamstring strain, Khawaja celebrated his recall with a glittering 144, with Queensland teammate Burns making 128 in front of a festive Melbourne Cricket Ground crowd to drive Australia to 345/3 at stumps.The pair's 258-run stand remained unbroken until well into the final session, with captain Steve Smith (32 not out) and Adam Voges (10) untested during the final overs.After a run of modest scores, Burns was tipped to make way for the returning Khawaja but middle- order batter Shaun Marsh was dropped for the stylish left-hander."It was just a nice feeling to make a 100 for Australia on Boxing Day," Burns told reporters.</img>Joe Burns upped his recent form to score a century Image: AFPJoe Burns upped his recent form to score a century Image: AFP"Certainly something to savour ... Hopefully we can go on and win the test match and win the series." Australia won the opener emphatically in Hobart and took a big stride towards sealing the three-match series with a game in hand after being sent in to bat by West Indies captain Jason Holder.Holder's decision was a poor one in hindsight, with the green-tinged MCG pitch flattening out in bright sunshine after rain held up play for an hour.His players again failed to rally, however, with the bowling tepid at best and fielding at times abysmal.Khawaja was dropped on 23 shortly after lunch after nicking a half-chance to gully. He also spooned the simplest chance to Marlon Samuels at cover to be reprieved on 142.He and Burns came together early after opener David Warner was dismissed for a quick-fire 23, and they erased any lingering confidence the Caribbean side nursed after their innings and 212-run thrashing in Hobart.Unbeaten at tea, Burns and Khawaja ramped up their attack in the final session and raced to reach their centuries.Burns reached his ton and second test century first with a punch for three through point.Khawaja followed two balls later, scrambling a single presented by a misfield.The pair ploughed on steadily to guide Australia past 250, with their opponents' hopes seemingly fixed on the batsmen suffering a lapse in concentration rather than succumbing to any sustained pressure.As it happened, Burns duly delivered after the drinks break, getting stumped after charging down the wicket to part-time spinner Kraigg Brathwaite.Khawaja appeared to succumb to fatigue rather than the bowler's guile as he tickled Jerome Taylor down the leg-side to be caught behind. Brathwaite said it was a "decent day" for the tourists."Obviously (we have to) try to build some pressure to not let them score so freely," said the spinner.Elsewhere the New Zealand Black Caps beat Sri Lanka by seven wickets in the first of their five-match ODI series at the Hagley Oval in Christchurch.The home team's victory was set up by opening bowlers Matt Henry and Adam Milne - in the team as replacements for Tim Southee and Trent Boult - whose hostile bowling restricted the visitors to 27/5 inside the first 10 overs. Man of the match Henry took four of those wickets, while Milne regularly bowled around the 150km/h mark in an innings in which Sri Lanka posted a paltry 188 all out after 47 overs.Milinda Siriwardana (66) and Nuwan Kulasekara (58) each scored half centuries but it wasn't enough to stem the tide against a New Zealand bowling unit which just didn't let up, with Doug Bracewell and Mitchell McClenaghan chipping in with three and two wickets respectively.Black Caps openers Martin Guptill and captain Brendon McCullum made light work of the chase, scoring 79 (56 balls, nine fours and four sixes) and 55 (48 balls, 11 fours and a six) to lead Mike Hesson's team to a seven-wicket win in just 21 overs. The second ODI will be played tomorrow, also in Christchurch. - Sports reporter and Reuters
