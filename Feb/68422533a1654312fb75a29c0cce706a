Madilonga had said the leader of the Zimbabwean delegation, a Superintendent Ncube, gave him Dramat's cellphone number and asked him to call the Hawks boss.Watchdog in mystery U-turn on DramatAny reference to phone records showing that Madilonga had used his landline to call Dramat on the evening that the Zimbabwean delegation arrived at Beitbridge. The January report said: "Cellphone records of Lt-General Dramat and Beitbridge Telkom records show that General Dramat received a call from 0155346300 at 20h56 on 04/11/2010."Any reference to meetings Dramat held with the Zimbabweans. "The report states that on 05/11/2010 General Dramat held a meeting with Zimbabwean police at Directorate of Priority Crime Investigation offices about the nationals who shot and killed one of their senior officers," read one excised line.An analysis of Sibiya's cellphone records, showing he "communicated with officers who were involved in the operation, eg Captain Maluleke, and sent more than 20 SMSes to Major-General Dramat".References to Maluleke's cellphone records that said he "also communicated with General Dramat in terms of outgoing SMSes at a very important milestone in the operation. However, General Dramat never responded."More than two pages of detailed findings that concluded "there is enough evidence that shows that General Dramat did not only know about the operation that led to renditions of Zimbabwean nationals but sanctioned it".
