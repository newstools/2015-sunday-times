Serves 8-10Pastry:180g (1 cups) flour2,5ml ( tsp) salt125g ( cup) cold butter70ml ice waterFilling:60g ( cup) butter200g (1 cup) brown sugar180ml ( cup) golden syrup2,5ml ( tsp) salt25ml Bourbon or whisky5ml (1 tsp) vanilla extract3 extra-large eggs200g (2 cups) pecan nutsCream to serveMethod:1) Preheat the smoker or oven to 200 C.2) Sift the flour and salt together then cut the butter into the flour with a knife, or use a food processor and process the flour and butter until it looks like breadcrumbs. Slowly add the ice water, adding enough to make a softish dough. Don't over mix.3) Use the pastry to line a 23cm pie dish and bake blind by covering with greaseproof paper, weighing it down with dried beans and baking for 5 minutes. Remove the paper and beans and return to the oven for another 5-7 minutes. Set aside.4) Combine all the ingredients for the filling except the eggs and nuts in a saucepan and stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Leave to cool for 15 minutes, then whisk in eggs.5) Sprinkle nuts over pastry base and pour over the filling. Bake at 200 C for 20 minutes, then reduce temperature to 160 C and bake for a further 40 minutes. Cut and serve with a dollop of cream.Chef's tip:Toast the pecan nuts in a dry pan for a smoky flavour if baking in the oven.
