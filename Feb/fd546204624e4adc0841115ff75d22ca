Sunday Times reporters have obtained two contradictory reports signed by Innocent Khuba, the Limpopo head of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid).Khuba led investigations into Dramat, Gauteng Hawks head Shadrack Sibiya, Hawks cross-border desk head Leslie "Cowboy" Maluleke and other Hawks officials accused of being involved in an operation that led to five Zimbabwean crime suspects being abducted and illegally deported.Once in their home country, they were tortured, two were killed and one disappeared.The Ipid investigation was launched in October 2012, sparked by a Sunday Times report a year earlier that detailed how Maluleke had allegedly abducted the five, who were suspected of killing Bulawayo fraud squad head Lawrence Chatikobo.He handed them to Zimbabwean police.After initially implicating Dramat and Sibiya, Khuba decided to clear them in his final report after receiving "additional evidence", which included technical evidence.The report said there was evidence to charge Maluleke.The directorate would not say what that new evidence was. Excised A comparison of the reports reveals there is little "additional evidence" in the final version. However, any evidence that could incriminate Dramat, including phone records, was mysteriously excised from the final report.The strange case of the disappearing evidenceThe final report did refer, for the first time in the 17-month investigation, to a letter retrieved from Maluleke's laptop that Khuba considered "a vital clue" that the operation had not carried Dramat's blessing.Maluleke addressed the letter to the director-general of home affairs, asking for help in deporting Zimbabweans suspected of murdering a police official there."[Maluleke] still put his name as an approving authority thereby confirming that he did not want his seniors to either know or become aware of his activities," Khuba concluded.He signed his first Case Investigative Report on January 22 2014.In this report, compiled after a thorough investigation that lasted more than 14 months, he recommends that Dramat, Sibiya and Maluleke "be charged criminally" for kidnapping and defeating the ends of justice.Less than two months later, on March 18 2014, Khuba signed his second and final report.Robert McBride, who had become head of the directorate on March 3, gave Khuba's final report his stamp of approval on April 9."The investigation established that there is no prima facie case against [Dramat and Sibiya]," said the report sent to the National Prosecuting Authority. "However, with regard to Lt-Col Maluleke, there is a prima facie case to sustain charges of kidnapping and defeating the ends of justice." Parts of the January report that incriminated Dramat, including detailed references to evidence against him - and conclusions reached based on this evidence - mirrored an earlier unsigned "progress report", purportedly written by Khuba, dated December 20 2013 and also obtained by Sunday Times reporters. All of this material was in Khuba's signed January report but excised from his final report in March.Portions of a statement by Richard Madilonga, a police official at Beitbridge, that incriminated Dramat were excised.References to phone records showing that Madilonga had called Dramat on the night a delegation of Zimbabwean police officials arrived at Beit Bridge asking to be let in for a meeting with the Hawks chief the next day were stripped from the final report.Madilonga said one of the Zimbabweans, a Superintendent Ncube, had given him Dramat's number. He then used his landline to call Dramat.Madilonga died in June, two months after giving Khuba his final statement."The cellphone records of Lt-General Dramat and Beitbridge Telkom records (Col Madilonga's extension) show that General Dramat received a call from 015-534-6300 at 20h56 on 04/11/2010," the January report said. This information was missing from the March report.In his January report Khuba concluded that "there is enough evidence that shows that General Dramat did not only know about the operation that led to renditions of Zimbabwean nationals but sanctioned it". Doubt Both reports cast doubt on Sibiya's involvement by pointing out that his phone records placed him in Pretoria on the night he was supposed to be in or near Diepsloot when the Zimbabweans were arrested there. However, based on the same information, the January report concluded that Sibiya (above) should be charged, and the March report that he should be cleared.The final report accused members of the police's crime intelligence of falsely trying to implicate Sibiya in the case.Based on the allegations, Sibiya was suspended in January. On Friday, the High Court in Pretoria ruled that his suspension was unlawful.Dramat won a similar ruling against his suspension in December but agreed to go on leave and was considering accepting a settlement to leave the police.However, the evidence against Maluleke, including that he allegedly forged deportation documents to take the Zimbabweans over the border illegally, remained in both reports.nbsp;The final report concluded that there was "overwhelming evidence" that Maluleke led the operation and used his position to gain co-operation for actions he knew "did not follow the legal procedure".Maluleke said this week that he had not been informed of any decision to charge him."It's up to them to prove in a court of law that I didn't have legal documents," he said. "Let them present the evidence."When contacted this week, Khuba and McBride refused to discuss the reports, or confirm or deny their authenticity.Ipid spokesman Moses Dlamini conceded that it had conducted "a review" of its investigative report."We will not discuss the merits or specific details of our investigation until the NPA has made its decision," he said.NPA spokesman Velekhaya Mgobhozi said this week that the agency was still studying "volumes of files" received 10 months ago.investigations@sundaytimes.co.za
