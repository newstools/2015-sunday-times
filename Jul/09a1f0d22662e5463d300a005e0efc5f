1) A good way to release the flavour and nutrients is to roast the vegetables and meat or chicken beforehand. Toss the ingredients in a little oil, place in a roasting pan and roast at 200 C till browning. Remove and add to the stock pot, pour over water to cover and bring to the boil.2) Covering the vegetables and meat with cold water also helps to draw out the flavours and nutrients.3) Season at the end of cooking.

Allow to cool in the fridge overnight and then spoon off the fat layer on the top before using or freezing. Stocks can be frozen in plastic zip lock bags.7) When making chicken stock, fry the onions, carrots, celery and garlic in a little oil before adding a whole raw chicken. Cover with water, add peppercorns and bay leaves, and boil till the chicken is tender and cooked through. Remove the chicken from the stock and when cool enough to handle, remove the skin and flesh from the bones. Return the bones and skin to the stock pot, bring back to the boil and simmer for 15 minutes before straining and using.8) Fish stock is made using all the fish trimmings (ask a fishmonger for offcuts) with mild-flavoured vegetables such as onion, celery, garlic, carrots and parsley. White wine can also be added with the water.9) Meat stock can be made more meaty with the addition of a spoonful of meat or vegetable extract, such as Bovril or Marmite.
