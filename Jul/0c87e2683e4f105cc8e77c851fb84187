The blood SA spilt, mentally, in Wednesday's third one-day international at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury stadium in Chittagong will be fresh on the ground when the first of two tests starts there on Tuesday.Yes, SA should easily win this match and the second test in Dhaka - almost as easily as they should have won the second and third ODIs, which should have been won as easily as the two T20s and the first ODI were ...Bangladesh did not morph from minnows to menaces between the first and second ODIs.SA, who less than four months ago were a win away from reaching the World Cup final, did not suddenly become a poor side. On-form Marsh Stokes Aussie attackDisappointingly, too much of the discourse has stooped to talking up Bangladesh, who did not win the series nearly as much as SA lost it.Not for the first time in this country, we are in denial.Bangladesh are a weak team who have learnt to paper over their limitations with pluck and discipline.SA, in ODIs two and three, played so far below themselves they should have had miners' lamps on their helmets.Their disinterest in matches that meant nothing until the wrong team won was almost palpable, even from across the Indian Ocean.Two of the reasons for the losses were the absence of AB de Villiers and Dale Steyn, who with Hashim Amla are this team's giants.But South Africans should get used to life after them. At 31, De Villiers, for instance, is a year younger than the others.But he has a history of injury and is on the verge of becoming a father. How much can he have left in the tank?</img>South Africa's captain AB de Villiers celebrates his century during the second One-Day International (ODI) against the West Indies at the Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg January 18, 2015.
