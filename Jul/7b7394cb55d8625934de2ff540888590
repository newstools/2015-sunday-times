It had seemed England, who had collapsed to 30/4 on Friday, might get through the third morning without losing a wicket.But Marsh, called up after fellow medium-pace all-rounder Shane Watson was dropped after Australia's defeat in the first test in Cardiff last week, succeeded where the key bowlers had failed by bowling Stokes off the inside edge for 87.At lunch England were 181/5 in reply to Australia's 566/8 declared, a deficit of 385 runs and still needing a further 186 to make the Ashes-holders bat again. Captain Alastair Cook was 56 not out and Jos Buttler unbeaten on five.Cook and Stokes checked Australia's progress with a fifth-wicket stand of 145 after coming together following a top-order collapse in the face of hostile fast bowling led by Mitchell Johnson.After Friday's play, which ended with England 85/4, Johnson had tried to goad Stokes by questioning whether he would still continue to bat in the "aggressive" fashion that has been England's watchword under new Australian coach Trevor Bayliss. But Stokes, who in May scored the fastest test hundred yet seen at Lord's, off just 85 balls against New Zealand, showed good judgment after resuming on 38 not out.The left-handed batsman deliberately uppercut Johnson over the slips for a boundary.Stokes then completed a 67-ball 50 when he off-drove Johnson for the eighth four of his innings, which also included a six.Meanwhile, Cook, 21 not out overnight, attacked when given the chance.Australia still had a huge advantage but their concern was apparent when Hazlewood's rejected leg-before-wicket appeal against Stokes, then on 60, was reviewed by skipper Michael Clarke only for replays to show the ball had pitched outside leg stump.Cook then went to 50 in 142 balls, including six fours. He was dismissed by Marsh on 96. Stokes, in sight of a second hundred in as many Lord's tests, fell to Marsh when he played on.England were all out for 312 and Australia chose not to enforce the follow-on.
