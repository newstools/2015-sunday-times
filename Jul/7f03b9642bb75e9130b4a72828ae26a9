This is according to several company and military insiders with first-hand knowledge of the deals and South African National Defence Force procurement documents seen by the Sunday Times. SANDF 'hostage' drama was passing panicThe deals involve businessman Mike Guimaraes and his companies American Products Services and Cranecor Africa. They are being investigated by the anti-corruption task team consisting of the Hawks, SARS and the National Prosecuting Authority."There is a multi-faceted approach on this matter," Hawks spokesman Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said.The sources say Guimaraes regularly inflated invoices, charged for work not done or completed, and in some instances double- or triple-billed the SANDF. None would be named, fearing victimisation.They also claim he paid off at least five senior military procurement officials, whose names are known to the Sunday Times, to clinch the deals and approve the payments.The documents reveal that in the past five years, American Products Services and Cranecor Africa were paid about R100-million for army contracts alone, which is just the tip of the iceberg.Entities Guimaraes controls clinched lucrative deals from the army and navy stretching back more than a decade, as well as with Sasol's liquid-to-fuels plant at Secunda and Eskom's power station at Medupi.Guimaraes's assets allegedly include a hotel, a string of holiday homes, shopping centres and an array of luxury vehicles in South Africa, a wine farm in Portugal and real estate on the Australian Gold Coast.The army contracts were to repair and service combat tractors, graders, giant Bell trucks and other military construction vehicles. Some vehicles he serviced and repaired are deployed in war zones where the SANDF is conducting peacekeeping operations, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, where commanders allegedly complained they kept breaking down.SANDF payment schedules, financial authorisations, restricted internal memos and interviews with several sources also reveal that Guimaraes:Was given military vehicle repair work worth millions after his contract expired last month, forcing officials to hurriedly try to regularise their paperwork afterwards;Got paid R472958 last month to service a grader that was written off "beyond economic repair" and "disposed" of in 2002; andWas paid R2.8-million in February to service nine Bell trucks destined for the Congo that broke down almost immediately, and was contracted last month to fix them again for an additional R2.7-million.Guimaraes did not respond to messages and detailed questions left for him over two days.The documents show Guimaraes also earned millions from jobs in the DRC last year. This includes R3.5-million paid to Cranecor and R4.2-million to American Products for "maintenance and repair" of military vehicles in July last year.On February 16 this year, Guimaraes was paid R2.8-million to service the nine Bell trucks sent to the DRC - a job allegedly done in record time."They came in on Friday and left on Wednesday, for a job that should have taken a month," said one company source. SA spies scary shopping list revealedFrom the company's offices in Boksburg, the vehicles were taken to Durban, then shipped to Tanzania before being trucked to Goma in the DRC."There they started to break down immediately and one of the generals complained," said the source. This was confirmed by a military source.Despite this, Guimaraes was awarded a R2.7-million contract in June to fix the same vehicles.Although his contract with the army expired on June 15, two days later 16 jobs for his company were approved but rejected by the electronic payment system.This led to an army memo hurriedly being sent to the central procurement centre requesting permission to use "a price quotation system" until a new contract with Guimaraes was in place.The SANDF said it was unable to respond to detailed questions by the time of going to press.investigations@sundaytimes.co.za
