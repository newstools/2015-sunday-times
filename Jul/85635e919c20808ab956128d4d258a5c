Sibiya's team arrested the Zimbabweans under the pretext that they were illegal immigrants implicated in the murder of a senior police officer in their home country.They were handed over to Zimbabwean police at the Beit Bridge border crossing without proper deportation papers.In Zimbabwe, they were tortured - two were killed and a third disappeared.Inquiry chairman Mxolisi Zondo found Sibiya guilty of:Zondo said: "The raid, arrest, detention and deportation were unlawful ... thus rendering Sibiya guilty of misconduct."But Zondo found that Sibiya was not guilty of defeating the ends of justice and said there was not enough evidence to place Sibiya "on the scene of operations or that he had any active role in both operations".Sibiya's "desperate attempt", however, to show he was not in charge of the operation did not detract from "his knowledge and sanctioning of the illegal rendition", said Zondo.</img>Gen Anwa Dramat at the police committee 18 April 2013.
