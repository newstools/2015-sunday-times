"We are not New Zealand," he said. "We won the World Cup final. We will play the way we play, which works for us, and if you like it, you like it."So there. Take that.Not only is that one in the eye for the innocents who believe that Brendon McCullum's team have shown the way cricket should be played, but it is also a devastating put down for the Black Caps, a team Haddin sledged mercilessly in the World Cup final after being shocked by how nice they all were during an early group game."We will play the style of cricket that works for us. We have a couple of guys who bowl at over 150km, so there are going to be times when it is uncomfortable out there," Haddin said."It is a lot easier to face 150km when they [the bowlers] are smiling at you. It does not mean everyone is sledging or going across the line. These guys bowl fast and their job is to intimidate and get the upper hand for us. "We come with the urn and England have to get it back off us, but it does not matter where you are placed, once you get a team on their own turf and with the hype all around it, things are different. You throw everything out the window and go for it."Haddin is the epitome of an Australian cricketer. Aggressive and positive with every move, the verbal conductor behind the stumps and a man who never gives up."I would hate it [to end my career without winning Ashes in England]," he said."This is the most exciting cricket you will play and it brings out the best in some of us and the worst in others. You do things in these series people don't expect to happen."From an Australian point of view, the Ashes brings something out in us and I think it is the same for the English."He hails Trevor Bayliss for a "massive influence" on his career as New South Wales coach, but Ashes rivalry puts friendships on hold.He will not have a beer with him until the end. - The Daily Telegraph, London
