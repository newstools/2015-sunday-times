The spinners reaped the reward of some tight bowling from paceman Mohammad Shahid who bowled five consecutive maiden overs after lunch to pile pressure on the visiting batsmen.Taijul broke the 78-run second wicket stand between Dean Elgar and Faf du Plessis when he removed Elgar for 47 runs.Shakib struck in the next over trapping du Plessis plumb in front for 48 to bring Bangladesh firmly back into the contest.The visitors added only 61 runs in 29 overs in post-lunch session after resuming on 104-1.Elgar shared 58 runs with Stiaan van Zyl in the opening stand to help South Africa make a solid start after skipper Hashim Amla won the toss and elected to bat on an easy pitch at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium.Off-spinner Mahmudullah took the wicket of van Zyl, who edged a catch to wicketkeeper Litton Das down the leg side, handing Bangladesh their first success of the day.Amla was unbeaten on nine at tea alongside Temba Bavuma on 20 not out as the Proteas looked to bounce back from their 2-1 loss in the preceding one-day international series.Bangladesh handed left-arm pacer Mustafizur Rahman a Test debut after his impressive start in ODI when he claimed 18 wickets in his first six matches.Mustafizur joined pacer Shahid, left-arm spinners Shakib and Taijul and leg-spinner Jubair Hossain in a five-pronged attack for the home side.South Africa left out four uncapped players Aaron Phangiso, Kagiso Rabada, Reeza Hendricks and Dane Vilas.The second and final Test of the series will be held in Dhaka from July 30 to August 3.
