Serves 4Difficulty: Easy, 45 minutesSyrup:360ml ClemenGold juice (about 8 squeezed ClemenGold)140g (2/3 cup) soft brown sugar125ml ( cup) strong rooibos teaRind of 2 ClemenGold, cut into thin stripsOther ingredients:8 ClemenGold, halvedCaster sugarVanilla ice cream, to serveJust desserts: Steamed citrus puddingMethod:1) For the syrup, place ClemenGold juice, sugar and tea in a wide saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a gentle boil, stirring until sugar has dissolved, then reduce heat and simmer without stirring for 7 minutes. Add ClemenGold rind and simmer for a further 7-10 minutes or until syrupy. Do not reduce the syrup too much because it will become very sticky. To test, spoon a drop of hot syrup onto a cold saucer. Allow to cool and pull your finger through the drop. If it is sticky and separates, it is ready. If it runs back, simmer for another 1-2 minutes and test again. Once ready, remove syrup from heat and set aside to cool.2) Preheat a griddle pan to very hot. Sprinkle each ClemenGold half lightly with caster sugar. Place fruit cut-side down on the griddle pan and press down till caramelised and nicely marked. Serve the grilled fruit with vanilla ice cream and a generous drizzle of syrup.
