De Kock, 22, was fined 75 percent of his undisclosed match fee for walking in front of the stumps to physically confront the batsman at the stroke of lunch on the second day on Wednesday.De Kock pleaded guilty to charges of "inappropriate and deliberate physical contact" laid by match referee Chris Broad, the ICC said in a statement."Quinton de Kock walked in front of the stumps to confront Tamim Iqbal. In doing so de Kock deliberately brushed Tamim Iqbal's shoulder and rib area," Broad said in the statement."This resulted in a heated exchange between the two, initiated by the contact made by de Kock. This type of incident has no place on a cricket field," he said.Tamim scored 57 runs to lay a strong foundation for Asian minnows Bangladesh before he was bowled by occasional left-arm spinner Dean Elgar.During the preceding one-day series, which Bangladesh won 2-1, South African batsman Rilee Rossouw was fined 50 per cent of his match fee for also shoulder barging Tamim.
