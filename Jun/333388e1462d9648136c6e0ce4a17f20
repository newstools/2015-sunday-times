Local media had speculated that Sangakkara will only play three more home tests - two in the ongoing series against Pakistan and one against India in August - before ending his glittering 15-year career.But Mathews, speaking to reporters at the second test against Pakistan in Colombo, said the team's senior player had still not made up his mind."Kumar has still to confirm his retirement plans," he said. "He was supposed to meet the press over the last few days, but he has not done that yet."I know he is still talking to the selectors."Left-handed Sangakkara, 37, is the leading current test batsmen. His 12271 runs and 38 centuries far exceed second-placed Alastair Cook of England, who has 9000 runs and 27 hundreds. Bavuma sets his sights on walking in at number fourThe 131-test veteran is unlikely to catch up with record-holder Sachin Tendulkar's test tally of 15921 runs and 51 hundreds, but his 11 scores of 200-plus are just one short of Australian legend Don Bradman's record of 12.Sangakkara had hammered 203 against New Zealand in Wellington in January, to continue a prolific streak that saw him make 221 against Pakistan and 319 against Bangladesh last year.Mathews denied that his former captain had delayed the announcement because of Sri Lanka's 10-wicket defeat in Galle which put Pakistan ahead in the three-match series."He had been speaking with the selectors even before the series began," Mathews said, adding the uncertainty had not affected the team morale."I think Kumar has earned the right to decide when he should go. He has served Sri Lanka well over the years and he will be missed when he goes. But it's now up to the young players to step into the shoes of Kumar and Mahela [Jayawardene]."Jayawardene retired from tests and Twenty20 cricket last year and quit the one-day format after the recent World Cup where Sri Lanka made the quarterfinals.
