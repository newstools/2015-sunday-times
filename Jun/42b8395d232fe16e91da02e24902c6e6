A senior government source with direct knowledge of the meeting said it was agreed that South Africa would protect Bashir by any means necessary - even if it meant flouting court rulings and undermining the constitution. SANDF 'hostage' drama was passing panicHe said the meeting was attended by Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe, International Relations Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane, Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, State Security Minister David Mahlobo and Police Minister Nathi Nhleko, as well as the director-general in President Jacob Zuma's office, Cassius Lubisi."After this meeting Bashir was given the go-ahead to fly down to South Africa and was promised maximum protection," said the source.On the Friday morning, as Bashir prepared to leave Sudan for Johannesburg, his ambassador to South Africa, Ali Yousif Ahmed Alsharif, is understood to have approached Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, who currently chairs the AU, for confirmation that the president would be protected."A concerned Mugabe summoned President Zuma and his former wife, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma [who is the chairwoman of the African Union Commission], to discuss Bashir's safety and protection before he could revert to Alsharif," the source said.Mugabe confirmed at a press conference this week that Zuma had given an undertaking that South Africa would not arrest Bashir as all delegates to the AU summit had been granted immunity.But as soon as Bashir landed, the government realised it was facing a court challenge to have Bashir arrested and handed to the International Criminal Court."Advocate William Mukhari, who represented the state, was briefed that he must delay the court hearing until Bashir is safely out of the country," the source said. Senior ministers were gloating on how they are going to teach the judges a lesson by secretly arranging for Bashir to leave before the matter is heard in court Mukhari yesterday denied he was instructed to use delaying tactics."That one is nonsensical, obviously. It can't be, because in any event, if he left even before the proceedings started, how can you delay proceedings when somebody has left already, if that is what they say, that he left even before proceedings started," Mukhari said."I don't even know what time he left, so I can't say."Mukhari took over the case from his colleague Isabelle Ellis on Sunday and told the court he needed time to read the documents. He asked for the matter to be postponed to the following day.The court granted the postponement on condition that Bashir would be prevented from leaving South Africa.But at the AU gala dinner on Sunday evening, word spread that Bashir had been tipped off that he must pack his bags and leave because the case did not bode well for him.</img>President of the Republic of the Congo Denis Sassou Nguesso (R) looks on next to Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir as they pose for photographers ahead of the African Union summit in Johannesburg June 14, 2015.

Bashir boarded the plane before his entourage, who joined him later at Waterkloof."He was escorted to Waterkloof on Monday morning. Al-Bashir should be in the dock - but so should Bush and Blair"When people were making noise on Sunday that he must be arrested, we just told Bashir to relax because there was no way he was going to be arrested," said a security services source."We had given him the assurance. We just told him he was going home and we would deal with the court later."Another senior government source confirmed that the decision to protect Bashir was taken long before he arrived - first by the ANC's national executive committee's subcommittee on international relations and later by the security cluster ministers at their Cape Town meeting last week.Obed Bapela, who heads the subcommittee, denied that a meeting on Bashir had been held ahead of the AU summit but backed the government's refusal to arrest the Sudanese leader.The source said ANC leaders and the security cluster ministers had launched informal probes into five NGOs - including the Southern African Litigation Centre (SALC), which took the government to court on the Bashir case - because they are regarded as fronts for Western powers who want to meddle in the political affairs of South Africa and other developing nations."They use legal means to frustrate the policies of the government. The government can't do anything and will spend the whole time in and out of court in order to defend its policies," said an ANC source. "In the process, service delivery suffers and people organise protests."SALC director Kaajal Ramjathan-Keogh said: "It looks as though they facilitated his departure. The state acted unlawfully and despicably." Horrors on ICC list of charges The International Criminal Court has charged Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir with a range of human rights violations dating back 12 years.The conflict in Sudan started in 2003 when rebels in Darfur took up arms against Bashir's government, accusing him of marginalising the area and failing to protect citizens from attacks by Arab nomads.Bashir responded by deploying Sudanese troops and the Janjaweed, an Arab militia group, to attack his own citizens in Darfur.An estimated 300000 Sudanese citizens have died.More than twomillion people have been displaced. We averted an African backlash, says ANCScores of women and children have been raped.In 2005, the ICC instituted an investigation into the abuses of human rights.In 2009, the court issued a warrant of arrest for Bashir, his minister of state for the interior, Ahmad Harun, and Janjaweed militia leader Ali Kushayb.A second warrant of arrest was issued in 2010.Bashir faces the following charges:Five counts of crimes against humanity - including murder, extermination, forcible transfer, torture and rape;Two counts of war crimes: intentionally directing attacks against a civilian population as such or against individual civilians not taking part in hostilities; and pillaging; andThree counts of genocide: genocide by killing; genocide by causing serious bodily or mental harm; and genocide by deliberately inflicting on specific target groups conditions of life calculated to bring about the group's physical destruction. - Sibongakonke Shobainvestigations@sundaytimes.co.za
