The Ashes series gets under way next month (July 8).The fearless brand of cricket pedalled by the Kiwis has rubbed off on the English, who have gone toe-to-toe with the tourists, and that, in turn, has whetted the public's appetite for the summer's main event - a key consideration given cricket's declining media profile.If England go about their business during the Ashes in the same manner as they have against the Black Caps, the procession of Australian triumphs predicted by many may not actually materialise, and even if it does at least the English will go down fighting and people may actually watch. Cricket in England needed a jolt and New Zealand have provided it.After a thrilling test series, during which England produced perhaps their finest display since the 2005 Ashes to win the first match, the hosts went on to do something that many thought was beyond them, and demolished one of the great one-day sides with a display entirely free of the fear, negativity and cluttered thinking that has characterised English 50-over cricket for decades.One swallow does not a summer make, but the omens are a lot better for England now than they were a month ago.It is too much to expect test captain Alastair Cook to completely adopt the freewheeling approach of McCullum this summer, but he has at least seen how it can work.England triumphed as they fought fire with fire in the first test. But the second test of the series, in which a brilliant New Zealand batting counterattack left England on the canvas, could prove just as instructive to Cook as he considers his options against Australia.In the one-day arena too, there is little doubt that New Zealand have inspired England. The appalling capitulation during the World Cup helped set the tone for the new approach that paid off so handsomely at Edgbaston.
