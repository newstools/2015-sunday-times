Gotta have him swinging for the fences. Makes brute force look pretty. Nerves of ice don't hurt, either.Steve Smith (Australia)Hides his magnificence behind a certain sleepiness and the most ordinary name in the game. If regular strokes don't fit the bill, he makes his own.AB de Villiers (South Africa)General Electric. Genius. Steve Jobs in pads.
