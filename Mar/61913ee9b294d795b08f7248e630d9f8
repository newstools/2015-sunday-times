When hot and bubbling, add the chocolate and put on the lid, with heat off, and leave to melt for 10 minutes.3) Add the caster sugar and vanilla, then the eggs and flour, mixing in well. Pour half the batter into a paper-lined brownie pan or medium loaf-pan.4) Scatter marzipan and orange pieces all over the mixture. Pour remaining batter over marzipan and candied orange pieces. Bake for 15-20 minutes or until gooey-crumby rather than just gooey. It is way better to be a little goey than too set.5) Leave to cool for 10-15 minutes before cutting into squares or rectangles.
