How to grow chillies in 5 easy steps1) Some chillies will keep fruiting even in winter if in a sunny, frost-free area. A sunny spot indoors will do the trick to bring your seeds on in trays at the beginning of spring.2) Choose a good-sized pot approximately 25cm wide and 25cm deep for your seedlings. Good drainage is essential for happy, healthy pot plants, so make sure there are adequate drainage holes to avoid a watery death.3) Place small stones at the bottom of the pot to prevent the holes clogging up. In larger pots, use broken bricks or terracotta crocks to cover the drainage holes and then a layer of river sand; this stops essential soil nutrients from washing away.4) Use a good potting soil to help the plants establish a strong root system. Transfer your seedlings into moist soil and keep them cool and slightly wet initially until the plants settle. There should be a space of about 35mm from the rim of the pot to the soil surface.5) Water every second day when the weather is hot and feed with a good organic liquid fertiliser once a month.Which varieties to growGood choices to grow are fiesta; jalape o; Scotch bonnet; peppadew; cayenne; bird's eye; habanero; serrano; paprika; banana; poblano; and tabasco.
