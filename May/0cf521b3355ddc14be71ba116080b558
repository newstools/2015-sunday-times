Essel Group, owned by billionaire Indian media mogul Subhash Chandra, has confirmed plans to launch a new global Twenty20 tournament similar to late tycoon Kerry Packer's creation of World Series Cricket in the 1970s.The conglomerate, which was behind the now-defunct Indian Cricket League (ICL), also reportedly wants to create a new breakaway world governing body for cricket, prompting the International Cricket Council to investigate.The ICL folded in 2009 amid accusations of match-fixing, and some players remain unpaid.Fairfax Media this weekend reported that captain Clarke and opener Warner have been earmarked for tempting 10-year deals as Essel Group tries to lure the world's leading players from their national boards.Poetry in motion as CSA gets to grips with changeNeither Clarke nor Warner have commented."We are aware of the reports around a rebel league and they remain highly speculative, particularly given the proposed scale and complexity," Cricket Australia chairman Wally Edwards said in a statement."Australian cricket has never been in better health. Record crowds, television audiences, grassroots participation and commercial support continue to drive record revenue; player payments have never been higher and will only increase."Edwards said the formation of a rebel league would jeopardise the wellbeing of the game.He indicated that the reported expected earnings over 10 years was not much higher than the current earnings of Australia's top players. "Australia's cricketers are the highest paid athletes of any team sport in the country," he said.
