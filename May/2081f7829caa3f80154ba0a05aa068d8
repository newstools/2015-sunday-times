Fallen leaves add essential charm to your autumn garden and they are also a gardening gold mine, both as protective mulch and material for compost.In flowerbeds and around trees they can be left to lie, provided they are not diseased. Elsewhere, you might need to redirect them on to beds or gather them up and recycle them. And here you might need to add some strength to your arm with some leaf-managing power tools, namely blowers, sweepers and vacuum shredders.Bulbs: The best garden investment you could makeWHICH GADGET IS BEST FOR YOUR GARDEN?1) Leaf blowers are increasing in popularity in South Africa. They make it easy to blow stray leaves on to flowerbeds or into a pile and from there to bags or the compost heap. Of all the power tools that rend the leafy quiet of the modern garden, they are the loudest.But things are changing. A new generation of garden tools powered by lithium-ion batteries has cut the decibel level dramatically. These are also easier to use than petrol-powered machines, mostly lightweight (about 3-5kg for a blower) with less vibration and no fumes. The battery packs are expensive, but they have a long life and fit sister appliances in the ranges - and you don't have to keep buying petrol.For small gardens, electric plug-in blowers offer a less expensive option. Some models also have a vacuum function.2) Vacuum shredders suck up leaves and shred them to 10% of their original volume - ideal for composting. Most of them also have a blowing function. Electric and petrol-driven models are available.3) Sweepers may be the answer if you have a large paved area. They look rather like a lawnmower, with roller and disc brushes that make a clean sweep. Battery-powered models are available too (try stihl.co.za).Visit stihl.co.za, flymo.com and bosch-garden.com. And for noise-approved appliances, visit the UK site quietmark.com.
