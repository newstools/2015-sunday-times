Dramat, Sibiya and four other Hawks officials should also be charged criminally for kidnapping and defeating the ends of justice, and should face internal disciplinary charges.These are among criminal charges recommended by Werksmans Attorneys in a report seen by the Sunday Times and understood to have been handed to Minister of Police Nathi Nhleko this week.Nhleko appointed Werksmans to investigate why findings of an Independent Police Investigative Directorate probe into police renditions of Zimbabweans were altered radically just days after McBride took over Ipid in March last year. Hawks head Dramat quitsTwo of the Zimbabweans were killed in police custody in Zimbabwe, one disappeared without trace and another was allegedly tortured after Hawks officials led by Captain Lesley "Cowboy" Maluleke allegedly took them over the Beitbridge border post at Musina with forged deportation papers in 2010 and 2011 and handed them over to Zimbabwean officials.READ THE FULL REPORT HEREAfter reviewing case documents and interviewing Ipid, police investigators, McBride and several senior prosecutors assigned to the case, Werksmans concluded that:McBride refused to comment yesterday. He said: "I am on suspension and not allowed to make any comment."His lawyer, Jac Marais, said: "The Werksmans investigation is fatally flawed legally and not sufficiently independent to meet the requirements of the constitution. The findings by the investigation will accordingly not carry any legal weight or significance." 'Why I suspended McBride'The Werksmans report also reveals for the first time that the NPA decided last month to prosecute Dramat and Sibiya after reviewing the docket, but that prosecutions boss Mxolisi Nxasana intervened irregularly to have the decision reviewed.On March 13, North Gauteng prosecutions boss Sibongile Mzinyathi sent a recommendation to Nxasana that "all the accused, including Dramat and Sibiya, be prosecuted for kidnapping and defeating the ends of justice".Evidently unhappy with this recommendation, Nxasana sent the docket to South Gauteng prosecutions boss Andrew Chauke on April 1 to review.The Werksmans report said this was irregular because "there is no authority" in the NPA Act for one regional prosecutor to review the decision of another. Only the NPA head has that power.Nxasana - who faces a probe into his fitness to hold office after it emerged he had been let off on a murder rap and has two assault convictions, one landing his girlfriend in hospital - was the only NPA official who refused to co-operate with the Werksmans investigation. Second Report The report highlighted crucial evidence against Dramat and Sibiya that McBride and his officials deleted when he produced a second report after the first recommended that Dramat and Sibiya should be charged.The report states: "The second report was created for the purpose of exonerating the high-ranking officials, specially Dramat and Sibiya, who were implicated in the first report."The report also found that "each of the co-signatories (McBride, Sesoko and Khuba) to the second report deny effecting the deletions". It adds: "We are of the view that the deletion of material evidence which is likely to affect the decision of the NPA in determining whether or not certain individuals should be prosecuted, is a criminal offence, specifically, defeating the ends of justice or obstructing the administration of justice."Khuba told Werksmans that he only signed the last page and did not initial each of the pages, McBride claimed he only made grammatical changes and Sesoko alleged that he never worked on the report.Other evidence includes Sibiya sending Dramat 30 text messages "at various milestones of the operation", and a letter to stakeholders dated August 20 2012 naming Dramat and Sibiya as officials in the joint operation with Zimbabwean police.I'm the victim of a political conspiracy - McBrideDramat and Sibiya's trip to Zimbabwe is not mentioned.Another major contradiction in the matter is that when the Zimbabweans were arrested, it was reported that they were wanted in connection with the murder of a senior police officer in their country.However, when former acting police commissioner General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi questioned Dramat and Maluleke in 2011 on the reason the foreigners were transported back to Zimbabwe, Mkhwanazi was told it was because they were "illegal immigrants".NPA spokesman Velekhaya Mgobhozi disputed the Werksmans report's claim that a decision to prosecute Dramat and Sibiya had been made.Mgobhozi said the docket was moved from Mzinyathi to Chauke "purely as matter of jurisdiction".Ipid spokesman Moses Dlamini said he had not seen the Werkmans report and could not comment.Dramat declined to comment, and Nhleko's spokesman Musa Zondi said: "We don't comment on leaked reports".investigations@sundaytimes.co.za
