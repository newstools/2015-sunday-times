Glowing red cabbages, silvery artichokes, feathery carrots, frilly lettuces, purple-sprouting broccoli, lush fountains of rainbow chard, red mustard and emerald-green mizuna... who needs flowers? The smartest gardens now - especially small ones - are brimming with gorgeous things to eat, and not just in pots and boxes or regimented plots, but everywhere.Sprouts: from seed to salad in just a few daysTrue, cottage gardeners have always mixed vegetables and flowers, but as our love affair with home-grown continues to burgeon, so has the tendency to reduce (or even largely dispense with) ornamentals in favour of edibles, which can be as decorative as any flower and satisfyingly worthy into the bargain.It may just be that we've learnt to appreciate the intrinsic beauty of vegetables, but the available range of heirloom varieties and colourful new hybrids also continues to expand, providing an irresistible palette for adventurous gardeners.It's all about playing with colours, forms and textures, combining tall and round and flat and flouncy in groups, with the occasional accent plant, just as you would with a mixed-flower border. And using edibles in all the ways you might use ornamentals.WHAT TO PLANTShade: grapevines, fruit treesScreening: sunflowers, sweetcorn, runner beansClimbers for trellises and obelisks: runner beans, sugar-snap peas, cherry tomatoes, sweet potatoes, boysenberries</img>Rhubarb will add a burst of colour to you garden Image: ThinkstockRhubarb will add a burst of colour to you garden Image: ThinkstockAccent and form plants: rhubarb, artichokes, cabbageFor height: broad beans, leeks, lovage, lemon grass, fennel, Jerusalem artichokesRobust leaves and strong forms: kale, cabbage, cauliflower, pak choiBright fruits: chillies, eggplant, sweet peppersBushy: rosemary and lots of other woody herbsFlowery: all the sages, especially pineapple sageFeathery fillers: fennel, carrots, parsley, dillGround covers: parsley, chives, thyme, oregano, mintLarge lush leaves: Swiss chard, mizuna, Japanese red mustard, sorrelDainties: cut-and-come-again lettuces, rocketEdible flowers: day lilies, nasturtiums, calendulas, violasSECRETS OF SUCCESS Most vegetables and herbs need plenty of sun. Prepare soil well, with plenty of compost. Start with a few trays of seedlings and pots of nursery plants. Don't crowd plants; they need space for light as well as sturdy growth. Go on to growing your own special favourites from seed. Sow suitable plants direct. Mark sowings with sand and thin seedlings ruthlessly. Keep well watered and feed regularly. Don't forget the new rave - indigenous edibles.
