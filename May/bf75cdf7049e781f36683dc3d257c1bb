WHAT ARE MICROGREENS?Oriental vegetables, rocket, loose-leaf lettuces and many of the same kinds of seed for sprouts can also be grown as microgreens for delicious salads. These are densely sown seedlings that can be cut when they have four to six true leaves and are at their most tasty and nutritious.From seed to salad in just a few daysHOW TO GROW MICROGREENS IN A SMALL SPACE:1. Microgreens need good light. Growing them on or in front of a bright windowsill is a good option, but beware of strong sunlight and hot glass, which may scorch them.2. Sow seed in shallow trays with drainage holes (a good way to recycle the deeper Styrofoam punnets). Use a good seedling mix or sieved potting soil.3. Soak seed for two to four hours before sowing.4. Moisten the soil well and sow seed lightly. Press in gently, using the base of another punnet of the same size.5. Cover until germination. Move to bright, even light as soon as seed has germinated.6. Mist soil daily and remember to give the trays a half turn every day for even growth.7. Cut when they have six true leaves (at about 5cm tall).8. Sow fresh trays weekly for a steady supply.
