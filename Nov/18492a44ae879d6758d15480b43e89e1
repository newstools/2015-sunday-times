Kevin Pietersen's batting, sans the flamingo shot and the exaggerated offside movement, is pretty much straight from the MCC coaching manual.Pietersen the person does not seem to be as cut and dried, even though life makes allowances for those who run against the grain. Pietersen is one of those.At 35 he should have been at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium warding off the threat posed by Yasir Shah, Zulfiqar Babar and the recently retired Shoaib Malik.Predictably, England lost the war against the Pakistani spin trio despite Alastair Cook's resistance and a better collective performance than the 2012 calamity when Saeed Ajmal left them dizzy and battered.While he spoke with a general acceptance that he will not be seen in a Three Lions T-shirt in the foreseeable future, Pietersen seemed to have a tinge of regret that his golden batting years will waste away in the T20 jungle.The likes of Kumar Sangakarra, Chris Rogers, Adam Voges and Mahela Jayawardene made the most of their advancing age as willow crafters. Pietersen will not be having an Indian summer, and that seems to hurt him. India makes us consider how far we've come"I know where my zones are and that's one of my biggest regrets because of the opportunities that I have missed out on. From the ages of 34 to 37/38, you see the likes of Sangakarra scoring hundreds. I could still be scoring hundreds and I think I still have another 10-15 test hundreds in me but that's not the case," he said."I've said over the last few years that I love batting and I'm batting as well as I have ever been, if not better because of my maturity and experience."Soon as I stop loving batting I may as well quit the game, but who knows how much cricket I have left in me. I may wake up next week with no interest in batting and rather be somewhere else, then I'll finish. That is not the case at the moment."Sharply dressed in golf shorts and takkies on a perfect golfing day, Pietersen had the walk and the look of a casual man who has more time to spare than most international cricketers would.The brashness of youth has given way to the grey hair and mellowness of age, with the latter quality evident in how he talks with the younger Dolphins players.In his abrupt upping of the sticks at the turn of the millennium, he complained of being a victim of the quota system, but the South African cricketing landscape has changed markedly and for the better.Having admitted that he can see the fruits of transformation in an interview earlier in the week, he seems to have made peace with the machinations that ended his international career. It was a storied one that started in Harare in 2004 and ended acrimoniously in Sydney 10 years later. On assumption of his role, then director of cricket Paul Downton and Andy Flower cast Pietersen aside after a disastrous 2013/14 Ashes campaign where England were whitewashed for the second time this century.A lifeline was partially dangled when Colin Graves took over as the England and Wales Cricket Board chairman, but when Andrew Strauss was appointed as Downton's replacement, the door was shut on him.Pietersen has made peace with that episode, which was partly of his own making after the "textgate" episode of the 2012 test series against SA in England, where he was dropped despite his epochal 149 in the second test at Headingley."I was disappointed with the way my career was terminated but the decision that was made was taken out of my hands so there was no point worrying about it, crying about it or creating issues about it," Pietersen said. "It was a decision that was made and I got on with it and lived my life."I live my days as positively as anybody else. I don't worry about yesterday and the decisions I have made. I still have a pretty good life, I enjoy what I do and I'm comfortable where I am in my life."sports@timesmedia.co.za
