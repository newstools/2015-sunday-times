In fact, it happens so frequently that friends around the braai will joke about doubling the estimated costs and taking out a loan to make sure the job is finished.Going over budget can place home owners in a financial predicament. It comes with the risk of having their building bond frozen by their bank until the extra money is furnished, and can lead to the building project grinding to a halt, with the contractor walking off site. At the crux of it is a poor understanding of the costs involved in building projects. Building costs should take into account, among others, variables such as labour, material, equipment, building codes, job-site conditions and standard markups applicable to the area. This can be done through a comprehensive Building Costs Analysis, followed by choosing the right contractor.

It also affords the home owner some protection against being overcharged.Choosing the right building contractor to undertake the project is the next important step towards getting the job done soundly and within budget find a professional who is accredited by the NHBRC, and a member of the Master Builders Association.
