The 41-year-old, who quit one-day cricket after the World Cup earlier this year, had suggested that he would leave the game after a two-test series against India in December-January.But with relations between the archrivals again strained and with that series in doubt, this England series may be Misbah's last."To be honest, I haven't made a decision on my retirement yet. I don't know if we will be playing against India this season or if there will be an alternative series coming up, so I've not made up my mind yet," Misbah wrote in a column for cricket.com.auPakistan are 1-0 up against England after winning the second test by 178 runs in Dubai. The first test ended in a draw in Abu Dhabi.A 2-0 series win will lift Pakistan to No2 in the International Cricket Council test rankings, previously briefly attained by them for a few days in August 2006. Misbah's personal form and fitness suggest he can carry on, having scored 3, 51, 102 and 87 in the four innings of the series.But he said a player should leave the game on a high."One should think about leaving the game with respect rather than leaving it when he is forced to leave," said Misbah.He will hope his team does not squander a good opportunity to win another test series, like they did against New Zealand, who fought back for 1-1 in Sharjah last year.The Sharjah Stadium pitch has been relaid and is likely to help spinners, with leggie Yasir Shah, who took eight wickets in Dubai, and left-armer Zulfiqar Babar, who managed three wickets, playing a key role.Shah worked with legendary Australian spinner Shane Warne in the nets on Thursday.Pakistan are likely to bring in Azhar Ali - who missed the first test with injury and second after his mother-in-law died - to open the innings in place of Shan Masood.England, who were routed 3-0 by Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates three years ago, are likely to bring in middle-order batsman James Taylor for Jos Butler, who has failed as wicket-keeper/batsman, managing just 34 in four innings.If that happens, Jonny Bairstow will keep wicket.
