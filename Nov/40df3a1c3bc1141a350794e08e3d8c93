We built Africology from a passion to heal. A small therapeutic studio turned into many spas, and production in a kitchen turned into our own laboratory, producing divine blends.Holistic therapy is the mind s ability to create an inner reality that is positive working with energy flow and cellular activation via meditation, then aligning skincare ingredients that are bio-identical to endocrine health. What goes into to creating Carolina Herrera's designer fragrancesNatural and eco-friendly beauty products are ones that are devoid of chemicals that can harm the body and environment ingredient selections that are natural, and that can be used on animals to heal, rather than test its chemical efficacy by inducing pain and torture. The final product cannot carry an animal-friendly logo if the ingredients themselves were tested on animals.I attribute Africology s success to our sincere intention to do good. We know that when Africology touches your skin, it touches your soul. Dedication, selection of only the purest ingredients, and trained therapists who are inspired to heal, coupled with service excellence, is our key to success.My home is small, decorated with soft pastel colours, simplistic, and filled with crystals and divine fragrances.My favourite way to unwind is to spend time on the Africology Soil farm. No TV: just the voice of my mind, the sounds of nature, and the sight of my lavender and sheep grazing bring a deep peace to my soul
