India makes us consider how far we've come"This is a timely reminder that we can never drop our guard in protecting the integrity of the game at every level," CSA chief executive Haroon Lorgat said in a statement."We have an effective partnership with the South African Cricketers' Association to ensure that all our players, support staff and administrators are well educated about the nefarious activities of corrupt people, and are aware of the consequences of falling victim to shady approaches."Our attitude to corruption will always be one of zero tolerance and we are confident that we have the necessary structures in place to effectively deal with any corrupt activity."We will relentlessly pursue under our code (of conduct) and the law of the land any persons we believe to be involved in corrupting the game and, with assistance from the police, we will also seek criminal prosecution."The internet has opened avenues for gamblers in India with many websites openly offering instructions on how to flout the law. One of them, www.onlinecricketbetting.net, claimed 40% of India's internet users had admitted to visiting gambling websites."There are very few, if any at all, cases where people have been arrested or fined for gambling online in India," the site posted on one of its pages.
