The Kiwis, trailing 1-0 in the series, struggled to build a defendable total to present Australia in the fourth innings after another fast-paced day's cricket of 13 wickets before 42372 fans. At the close, the Black Caps were finding batting difficult under lights and were 116 for five with a result looming on today's third day.New Zealand had lost their top batsmen and still at the crease were BJ Watling on seven with debutant Mitchell Santner not out 13.Josh Hazlewood led the Australian attack in the absence of injured spearhead Mitchell Starc as the pink ball again dominated the bat.The second day turned on a contentious challenge decision in Australia's favour before dinner, enabling them to go on and grab a 22-run innings lead.Nathan Lyon survived a review in which 'Hot Spot' revealed a mark on the back of his bat before he had scored.The review was churned over for minutes before the TV umpire Nigel Llong decided there was not enough to go on despite the 'Hot Spot' evidence to give Lyon out, with Australia reeling at 118 for eight and trailing the Kiwis by 84 runs.Lyon walked three-quarters of the way off the ground believing he was out before he returned to continue batting and join in a record Australian trans-Tasman series 74-run ninth-wicket stand with Peter Nevill.
