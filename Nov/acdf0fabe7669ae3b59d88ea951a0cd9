I have been thinking of hairballs a lot of late, because it is Movember, that terrible time of year when previously sentient men forget how to spell and how to shave.Those bristles casting an ever-lengthening five o' clock shadow over the world are the fault of The Movember Foundation, manned by a group which aims to improve the health of men. Their mission may be laudable, but why they chose a furry upper lip as their banner is beyond me. Might Stikeez follow Spoof into the dictionary?Participants have to remove all facial hair by November 1, after which they may not apply a razor to the part between their nose and their gnashers until December. Whether they grow hair on other bits of their face is up to them.Men are encouraged to talk about their mustaches to anyone who will listen, which is by far the most annoying part of this initiative, because when a man tells you how his whiskers are going to help all men live longer, happier lives, it is almost impossible to look away from the ragged stoat clinging desperately to his bobbing philtrum.Let us face facts: "mustache" is not a particularly interesting word, except in Dutch slang, where de befborstel is dedicated to the stimulation of . well, never mind, my point is that "sideburns" are far more fascinating, because the word was accidentally coined by someone either drunk or dyslexic.Mustaches growing vertically from jaw to ear were originally known as "burnsides", named after US Army General Ambrose Everett Burnside, Civil War soldier, railway executive, inventor, industrialist, and politician, mostly famous for the bushy wings that extended from either side of his face.Sideburns, if you ask me, should burn in the barber's bin along with the jagged remnants of Movember, but there are other words of surprisingly hirsute origin that we should keep. Planets have inspired a world of wordsThe caterpillar is a charming creature known for smoking a hookah pipe in children's books, but did you know that the word "caterpillar" means "shaggy cat"? The Online Etymology Dictionary tells us it comes from the Late Latin catta pilosa, a combination of catta ("cat") and pilosus ("covered with hair").The Latin word for hair was pilus, which gave us the words "pill", "pellet" and "pillage". Pills and pellets both started their lives as hairballs, while "to pillage", before it became associated with looting and plundering, originally meant "to strip of hair".I can think of a few Movemberists I'd like to pillage, but that might be seen as an act of caprice, which happens to be another hairy word. When we call someone "capricious" these days, we mean they are apt to change their mind at whim, one day growing a goatee and the next shaving it off. One theory on the etymological origins of caprice does involve wild goats, possibly because you never know which way they might jump, but the theory I prefer says that it comes from the Italian words capo, which means "head" and riccio, which means "frizzled" (as in perms from the 1980s).Riccio is also Italian for "hedgehog", so calling someone capricious is the same as calling them "hedgehog-head".Remember that next time you are lost for words in a conversation involving a mustache.E-mail your observations on words and language to Sue de Groot on degroots@sundaytimes.co.za or follow her on Twitter @deGrootS1.
