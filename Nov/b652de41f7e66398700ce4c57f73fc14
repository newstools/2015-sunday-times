 Like all South Africans, Tshwane residents (consumer, business and government) have telecommunications needs. This project will help satisfy those, says Craig Carthy, director of open access Layer-1 infrastructure company LinkAfrica. He stresses that there is such a backlog of state-of-the-art communication infrastructure enabled by fibre optic networks, that it will take some time until every resident has a modern telecommunications service. Rivals spend big to ramp up the fibre in SA's telecoms dietAfter a long legal battle to implement the fibre optic network, the court has decided on the rights of the various parties involved. Following this judgment, telecommunications firms such as LinkAfrica can now set about deploying networks on public and private property in a responsible manner, giving due regard to applicable legislation, such as common law of servitudes, bylaws, health and safety laws.For the introduction of the network into Tshwane, telecommunications firms are expected to approach property owners to inform them that they have a requirement to install fibre optic cables on their property. Any installation entails a lot of mess, as these cables are traditionally buried underground. We will deploy the fibre optic network with our patented technology, Focus [fibre optical cable in underground systems], which is used by all South African telecommunications firms, such as voice and internet service providers, to place cables in existing sewers and stormwater pipes. This will be a faster and cheaper deployment, and cause less destruction of roads and pavements. Once installed, the tenants and property owners can enjoy being connected to the digital age, he concludes.
