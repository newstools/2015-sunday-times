1. WATERMELON WITH MINT &amp; LIME Mix cup of chopped fresh mint with the zest of 2 limes and 100g (1/2 cup) sugar. Arrange 12 cold watermelon triangles (skin on) on a plate and squeeze over the juice of 2 limes. Sprinkle with the mint-lime sugar and serve.2. ROASTED WATERMELON DESSERT SOUP Cut about 24 x 3cm blocks out of the solid flesh of a ripe watermelon, and save the mushy bits (not the seeds) for later. Dry-fry the cubes in a hot pan for a few seconds on each side. They should be lightly caramelised but not cooked. Chill in the fridge. Heat 100g (1/2 cup) caster sugar, 10ml (2 tsp) water and 15ml (1 tbsp) finely grated fresh ginger in the pan, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Remove from heat and allow to cool. Blend with 1.5-litres of the seeded watermelon pulp, then stir in 1 tbsp chopped fresh mint. Serve the roasted watermelon chunks in a bowl with the fruit soup, and panna cotta, cr me caramel or ice cream on the side.3. PRAWN &amp; WATERMELON SALAD Make a vinaigrette by mixing the juice of 1 lime with 5ml (1 tsp) runny honey, 45ml (3 tbsp) olive oil and salt and black pepper to taste. In a salad bowl or platter, combine 500g peeled and cooked prawns with 1 thinly sliced red onion, 4 cups seeded and diced watermelon, 2 seeded and finely chopped green chillies and 2 diced avocados. Toss the vinaigrette through the salad and sprinkle with cup coarsely chopped fresh coriander. Chill for 10 minutes before serving.
