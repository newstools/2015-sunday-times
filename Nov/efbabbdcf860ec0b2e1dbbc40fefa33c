A bond originator s assistance can make a huge difference to the mortgage bond applicant s chances of success.There are many members of the potential home-owning public who are not as yet aware that they can apply for a bond via a bond originator, and that in so doing, they may well improve their chances of success or of getting more competitive terms.South African banks, by and large, have very good reputations for looking after their customers, and it is therefore wholly understandable that many members of the public go directly to their banks for their home loans.
