Spoon into the cooled prepared crust and smooth the top.3) For the topping, pour the coffee over the chopped chocolate and stir until the chocolate has melted, then leave to cool to room temperature. It should thicken slightly, but still have a pouring consistency. Pour in a criss-cross pattern over the filling and sprinkle with nuts. Refrigerate overnight.
