THE MYTH: CUTTING YOUR HAIR MAKES IT GROW FASTERTRUE OR FALSE? "Your hair growth rate is determined by many factors, such as genetics and overall health, but cutting it is not one of them," says Unilever research and development manager Cassandra Taylor. Hair will typically grow about 1.5cm a month and is dead from the moment it erupts from your scalp. Nothing that you do to your dead hair can impact its growth rate.If you want your hair to grow faster, improve your nutrition and health and minimise exposure to pollution so that you get optimal blood flow to the scalp. If you want your hair to grow longer, try and minimise the damage that you do to your hair, which causes it to break.THE MYTH: THE THREAT OF SKIN CANCER IS LESS IF YOU HAVE DARK SKINTRUE OR FALSE? "Dark skin has more melanin, which is protective against sun damage, and skin cancer is less common, but the risk still exists. In fact, an aggressive type of melanoma is found on palms and soles," says Laserderm dermatologist Dr Noori Moti-Joosub."Sunscreen with adequate SPF and good UVA protection is necessary for all types of skin, especially in South Africa."</img>The Environmental Working Group is encouraging companies to remove the chemical triphenyl phosphate from their beauty products.

Some nail polishes contain the chemical triphenyl phosphate (TPHP), which recent research by Duke University and the Environmental Working Group (EWG) has shown affects hormone function. TPHP make nail polish flexible, but the EWG is encouraging companies to remove the chemical from products.Because of the potential harm of TPHP, Ordinary Skincare cofounder Dr Claire Jamieson says: "I would definitely discourage varnishing children's nails. It is not cool or cute and could be dangerous. They do not have a choice. For adults, it is an informed choice. Consumer pressure will result in better products."THE MYTH: SUNBEDS ARE SAFETRUE OR FALSE? Dermatologist Dr Noori Moti-Joosub says: "Sunbeds emit UVA radiation, which has been proven to be a highly carcinogenic form of radiation. Thus, in no way does a sunbed give you a safe tan. Recent studies show that one minute of sun exposure in the midday Mediterranean sun is less harmful than one minute of exposure on a tanning bed."Beat the clock: 5 anti-ageing ingredients that actually workTHE MYTH: BLEACHING OR RELAXING YOUR HAIR CHANGES THE HAIR SHAFTS PERMANENTLYTRUE OR FALSE? "Change [bleaching or relaxing] requires a chemical process to alter the chemistry in your hair," says Unilever research and development manager Cassandra Taylor. "The main chemical bonds in hair that are responsible for its shape are also responsible for its strength. To change hair's shape or colour, these chemical bonds need to be broken. Most often, these bonds are not reformed correctly, which results in hair being weaker, drier, less flexible, and hence more brittle and prone to breakage."THE MYTH: YOU HAVE TO LIE IN THE SUN TO GET SUFFICIENT DOSES OF VITAMIN DTRUE OR FALSE? "Often, the 10 minutes of sunshine required to produce vitamin D can be obtained from normal daily activities, such as driving, and does not require basking in the sun," says Laserderm dermatologist Dr Noori Moti-Joosub.THE MYTH: PARABENS ARE BADTRUE OR FALSE? Parabens are essentially preservatives, which are needed when there is high water content in a beauty product. Are parabens really that bad? A: "No," says Ordinary Skincare cofounder Dr Claire Jamieson. "There is no reliable research showing that parabens mimic oestrogens."If you want to avoid parabens, try balms and solid-texture products.
