That's if South Africa's credit regulator gets its way. An investigation by the National Credit Regulator into Shoprite Investments and Shoprite Insurance Company has revealed that the group's two subsidiaries sold retrenchment and occupational disability cover - to pensioners receiving government old-age grants. The group also recklessly gave credit to consumers. The regulator has referred Shoprite to the National Consumer Tribunal for breach of the National Credit Act, and asked that: Shoprite be ordered to refund affected consumers the retrenchment and occupational disability premiums; The group be audited; Reckless loans be written off; and Shoprite pay an administrative fine. Power Report: Merc owner haunted by her car's 'evil twin' The regulator's acting manager for investigations and enforcement, Jacqueline Boucher, said: The sale of retrenchment and occupational disability covers to pensioners and consumers receiving government social grants is unreasonable and imposes an unreasonable cost to such consumers, because they cannot claim benefits under these covers. Credit providers are required by law to explain the terms and conditions of insurance policies to consumers at the point of sale. Consumers should not be sold insurance that is not suitable and appropriate for their needs, Boucher said. Shoprite spokeswoman Sarita van Wyk said the group had not received any documents from the regulator, so she could not comment. "Once such documentation has been received the relevant allegations will be investigated immediately," she said.
