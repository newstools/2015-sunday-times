Tendulkar and Warne are headlining a three-city cricket tour next month with stops at baseball stadiums in New York, Houston and Los Angeles. One of the first major cricket events in the US, the Cricket All-Star Tour will serve as many Americans' first taste of the world's second-most popular sport.They will play Twenty20 cricket. There will be clinics with players, and fans will receive Cricket 101 booklets."Americans have heard about cricket, but a lot of it is 'Wow, that game's been going for five days and there's still not a result? It's boring and it takes too long'," Warne said in a telephone interview from London. "This format is very exciting."For the lead sponsors, which include PepsiCo, MasterCard and State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance, it means entry into South Asian communities across the US. All for one, one for all"That's an important market for us," said Edward Gold, State Farm's advertising director.The event was created and organised by New York-based marketing firm Leverage Agency. Declining to say how much the events cost to run, Ben Sturner, the agency's chief executive, said the tour should turn a profit in its first year if the stadiums sell out. The plan is to expand to other cities.Tickets for the games at Citi Field on November 7, Minute Maid Park (November 11) and Dodgers Stadium (November 14) go on sale this week.Prices will range from $50 to $175, said Sturner.Cricket's 2015 World Cup reached a broadcast audience of 1.56 billion, said the International Cricket Council.In the US, the sport is too small to be tracked in the Sports and Fitness Industry Association (SFIA), and the national cricket association has a strategic plan to reach 50000 American participants by 2017. By comparison, SFIA counts 2.4 million whitewater kayakers in the US, and 2.5 million participants in pickleball, a racquet sport combining elements of tennis, badminton and ping-pong. - Bloomberg
