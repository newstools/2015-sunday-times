In a plea bargain signed on Wednesday, the head of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate in Limpopo, Innocent Khuba, confessed to all charges against him, including editing the rendition report, and directly implicated McBride and Ipid head of investigations Matthews Sesoko.Khuba's guilty plea might complicate McBride's efforts to clear his name and get his job back.However, in a later development that at first appeared to muddy the waters further, Khuba allegedly signed an affidavit clearing McBride of direct involvement in the matter of the altered report.Khuba, represented by his attorney Moloko Phooko, pleaded guilty to charges of dishonesty and defeating the ends of justice at his disciplinary hearing at Ipid headquarters in Pretoria on Wednesday.Yesterday, McBride sent Sunday Times what he claimed was an affidavit signed by Khuba on Friday, in which he allegedly made a U-turn and exonerated the embattled Ipid chief.

They were later tortured in their home country. Two of them were killed and a third disappeared.Dramat accepted a golden handshake when the scandal about the doctored report broke.Sibiya was fired after being found guilty at an internal disciplinary hearing in July.Advocate William Mokhari SC, the pro forma prosecutor in the matter, yesterday said Khuba's guilty plea could have consequences for McBride. Mokhari said Khuba, contrary to media reports, did not submit any affidavits during the hearing clearing McBride."He [McBride] could not be exonerated by the hearing because it was not his hearing in the first place. And Khuba never mentioned him in the hearing," Mokhari said.Khuba, according to Mokhari, was not required to explain himself because he had pleaded guilty.

That becomes necessary if you want to exonerate yourself or you want to explain a particular point. But if you go there and say, look, I am guilty, all that has to be recorded is your guilt and findings."The other thing of how it happened may come out in the hearing of McBride and Sesoko because he [Khuba] will be asked," Mokhari said.He said the recorded proceedings "took something like five minutes"."He [Khuba] said: 'I understand the charge, and I plead guilty, freely and voluntarily.' And he signed the guilty plea. From there it was taken to the hearing. It was read out by the chairperson who asked him, also through his lawyer: 'Do you understand what it is you are pleading guilty to?' And he said: 'Yes.'"The chairperson then pronounced him guilty on the charge as it was. Then the proceedings ended," Mokhari said.Khuba yesterday declined to comment, saying: "I am not allowed to speak to the media."McBride and Nhleko have been embroiled in endless court battles since they fell out over the Ipid report that was tampered with.McBride has taken his boss to the Constitutional Court.investigations@sundaytimes.co.za
