"Surf shops have a range and design of shorts and T-shirts that are more age-appropriate than what's on offer at major retailers," said Aves, of Durban.She said it had not always been this way; when buying in the two- to six-year range, it was easy."Now that they have moved into the seven- to 14-year range, I often find the clothes unsuitable."She said either the slogans used were not appropriate for this age group, or the design and cut of the clothing were too grown-up."The clothes are basically mini-adult clothes. What happened to little girls looking like little girls?"Like many other parents, Aves is uncomfortable with how retailers lump tweens and teenagers into the same clothing range, saying she would never dress a seven-year-old in the same clothes she would select for a 14-year-old.Taking issue with unsuitable children's clothing is not new to Aves. Three years ago she objected to an Ackermans "I'm Single" Hello Kitty T-shirt for her daughters, then seven. Ackermans' response? "It's harmless and light-hearted."
