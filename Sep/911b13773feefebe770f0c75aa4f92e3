India 'A', comprising young talent drawn from across the country, chased down a competitive 189-3 by the tourists with two deliveries to spare at the Palam ground.The surprise win was fashioned by uncapped openers Manan Vohra and Mayank Agarwal, who gave their team a flying start with a 119-run partnership in 12.4 overs.Vohra hit a 42-ball 56 and Agarwal smashed 87 off 49 balls that included 12 boundaries and two sixes.Upcoming batsman Sanju Samson steered the hosts home with an unbeaten 31 off 22 balls, leaving the Proteas with much to ponder ahead of the tougher contests ahead.
