At least eight people abroad have been killed by the defective inflators, and more than 100 injured.The latest linked death was confirmed in June; a Los Angeles woman died after the airbag in a 2001 Honda Civic ruptured, firing metal shards at her.More than 270000 Toyota, Honda, Nissan and Mazda vehicles on South African roads - certain models from 2001 to 2014 - are implicated in what is considered one of the worst global recall crises in automotive history.From the first death related to a Takata airbag and the recall of 500000 Hondas in 2009 to the latest round of recalls announced a few months ago, some 30 million cars have been recalled worldwide.In June, Japanese airbag maker Takata finally admitted its products were defective, apologising for the deaths and injuries it had caused. The company, which now faces multiple lawsuits, said it was aware of 88 ruptures out of about 1.2 million airbags deployed in the past 15 years.Although a definitive cause of the fault hasn't been established, the defect is linked to a chemical propellant that helps inflate the airbags. Concerns have been raised about moisture exposure over a long period; the airbags are vulnerable to high humidity. Not quite lock, stock and barrelLittle of this critical information, however, has been shared with local consumers. In fact, many drivers of cars fitted with Takata airbags are completely unaware of the drama that's been unfolding in the US in the past six years.Why? Because car manufacturers choose to handle recall announcements through limited website statements and press releases, many of which end up in specialist motoring publications.Formal recall letters are usually handled by the Electronic National Traffic Information System, eNatis - which keepsa database of all registered car owners - on behalf of manufacturers.The process seems to bypass a key intention of the National Consumer Commission recall guidelines that encourage the publication of prominent public recall notices (adverts) in the general press. Such notifications are supported by the Motor Ombudsman, Johan van Vreden, who said this week they "not only assist consumers but also serve to prove manufacturers' good faith".The guidelines even recommend the format of such notices, suggesting the use of an image of the recalled product and full disclosure of the hazard, risks, and remedies. Unfortunately, due to a legal technicality, the guidelines are not enforceable.Toyota SA's recall statement in May said airbags in Corolla, Yaris and Run-X models from 2002 to 2007 and RAV4, Hilux and Fortuner from July 2003 to December 2005 could be "susceptible to abnormal deployment in a crash", and that "worldwide, no injuries or fatalities caused by this condition have been reported". Hardly the most candid overview of the problem."We do not place adverts for recalls; individuals are contacted via their dealers," was the response I got from Toyota SA spokesman Clynton Yon this week."There is a standard operating procedure that involves all stakeholders to ensure that as many affected customers as possible are notified."He said Toyota SA's campaign, which started in 2013 and includes both driver and passenger airbags, was "ongoing". It involves 200000 cars.Two Run-X owners, with 2004 and 2005 models, knew nothing of the airbag recall on their cars when I asked about it this week.In a statement in November last year, Honda SA listed just 481 Jazz (2004 model) and 536 Brio (2012 to 2014 model), saying the driver's airbag "may deploy with excessive pressure during an accident", which could result in the rupture of the airbag inflator canister. "Should this happen, the possibility exists that small fragments might enter the passenger compartment potentially causing injury."Honda SA has since updated its website to add the Accord (2003 to 2009), Brio (2012 to 2014), Ballade (2009 to 2011), Civic (2001 to 2009), CR-V (2002 to 2007, and 2011), Jazz (2002 to 2012) and Insight (2010 to 2012) .Honda SA spokeswoman Joeline Dabrowski said this week it had replaced airbags in just 1000 cars belonging to the 6500 customers mailed so far."At the end of July, we were advised of an extension to the recall of approximately 43000 vehicles," said Dabrowski. The Honda SA tally is now around 50000 cars, affecting both driver and passenger airbags.Although Honda's initial recall was relayed in a press release and on social media, and the expanded recall updated on its website, a 2007 CRV owner I spoke to this week was unaware of it (see story, right).Nissan SA also revealed additions to its initial announcement made last December - which identified only Nissan Almera models produced between 2001 and 2003. The net has now widened to 17400 cars, including Almeras produced between 2007 and 2008, as well as 2006-2008 X-Trail, Patrol and Terrano II vehicles.Mazda SA said 326 Mazda 6 models from April 2002 to June 2003 were affected.
