The Cape Town pensioner believes he could be a victim of a major defect that has bedevilled the brand's US CR-V models for years.Honda SA, however, says the two are in no way linked.But Spagnoletti, who has been quoted R4700 to have the locks repaired, thinks it's too much of a coincidence.It's not too hard to be suspicious. Last year, a class action settlement was reached with American Honda Motor to resolve allegations that the door locks in its Honda CR-V from 2007 to 2008, and certain 2009 models, were defective.According to reports, the lawsuit was filed in January 2013 by three consumers after an extensive investigation was conducted into the faulty door lock systems.Power Report: Action on fatal airbags is less than total recallThe consumers alleged that the actuator, part of the lock system, was defective and that Honda knew about the defect but hid it from owners to avoid having to cover the repair costs. Honda denied the allegations but agreed to settle. Now all affected Honda CR-V drivers in the US are entitled to a free replacement of the driver's door lock actuator, even if it is functioning properly. Those who have already replaced their locks are refunded. Honda also agreed to extend the warranty on the four occupant door lock actuators.Honda SA spokeswoman Joeline Dabrowski said this week the US case applied only to CR-Vs in the North American market, which were manufactured there with different parts suppliers."The Honda CR-V model sold in Europe and South Africa was not affected by any extended warranty or recall campaign conducted in the US," said Dabrowski. The current-model CR-V sold in South Africa is manufactured in Thailand; Spagnoletti's model was made in the UK."There comes a time in the life of a vehicle when certain elements are required to be replaced," said Dabrowski."We can confirm that this particular [lock] problem has not been highlighted to be a concern [in South Africa]."Meanwhile, Spagnoletti, who knew nothing of the airbag recall until this week, has asked Honda to confirm if his car is affected. He's still waiting.
